# Product Research & Development (PRD)

## Overview
Products can be developed under two different lifecycles; the proposer should be able to specify these.

  * **Full**: Takes longer and captures more details
    
  * **Expedited**: 
    * Shorter lifespan
    
    * Usually involves creating the base idea for a product, a modification to an existing product, or a \[priority\] process product 
    
All comments and feedback throughout the process should be saved for auditing, so teams can track the evolution of the product

Product *proposer*, *product owner*, and *interested parties* should receive notifications at each major PRD phase, with a summary of information relevant to that phase

  * *what constitutes an interested party?*

## Proposal

#### Rules:

If the proposer specifies an *expedited* R&D process, they further need to specify whether:

  * Proposal is for an *existing* product
    
    * proposer must provide the *unique identifier* for the product to be modified
  
  * Proposal is for a *new* product

If the product is *physical*, the proposer further needs to specify whether a *prototype* or a *full product* is to be the final product.

  * If proposal type is *expedited*, a *full product* can only be developed if an existing product
  
    * exists, and
    
    * is referenced
